# Standards — Flutter Agent OS

Binding rules for Flutter code, plans and process. Skills cite these; they do not restate them.

**Two lifecycles.** Framework standards live here and are versioned with the framework. Some are **templates**: `@flutter-foundation` P3 copies them into `{FLUTTER_STANDARDS_ROOT}` (`.work.flutter/standards/`), fills every `REPLACE:` token from the foundation docs and `STACK.md`, and from that moment the **project copy is binding**. The framework copy is never edited per project.

**Zero unreplaced tokens** in a project copy is a P3 gate and a `@flutter-plan-verify foundation` check.

## Precedence

When two sources disagree, higher wins:

1. **Human instruction in the current message** — overrides everything, for that message only, and is recorded in HANDOFF.
2. **`.cursorrules`** — the repo's operating contract.
3. **Project standards** in `{FLUTTER_STANDARDS_ROOT}`.
4. **Approved SPEC** for its own feature.
5. **Framework standards** (this directory).
6. **Ecosystem convention** (Effective Dart, Material guidelines).

A conflict between levels 2–5 is a **finding**, not a judgement call: report it and route to `@flutter-plan-repair`. Silently picking one is how two sources of truth become permanent.

---

## Waivers

A standard can be waived, never ignored. A waiver requires: the rule, the scope (files or feature), the reason, the risk accepted, the expiry or removal condition, and the approver. Record it in `{FLUTTER_WORK_ROOT}/decisions/` as an ADR and reference it from the code with a single comment naming the ADR. `@flutter-verify` treats an unwaived violation as a finding and a waived one as recorded debt.

---

## Editing

Framework standards change through `CONTRIBUTING.md` (new date-stamped file; the old one stays for historical plans). Project copies change through `@flutter-plan-repair`, which re-runs `@flutter-plan-verify foundation` afterwards.
